     <h1>Isak 'happy' at Newcastle but 'no talks' held about future</h1>
     <h3>Newcastle striker Alexander Isak has put talks over his future on hold as he attempts to help end the club's 70-year wait for a domestic trophy in Carabao Cup final.</h3>

     <h1>Man Utd new stadium plans 'pathetic' - Merson</h1>
     <h3>Manchester United are more interested in building a state-of-the art stadium than they are in producing a competitive football team, argues Paul<br> Merson.</br> </h3>

<h3>The 25-year-old's scintillating goalscoring form - 22 so far this season - has seen him repeatedly linked with a move away from St James' Park, with Arsenal among the long list of admirersHowever, Isak insists he will not allow the speculation to derail Newcastle's bid to go one better than they did against Manchester United in the same competition showpiece two seasons ago.

    "This club can achieve great things," he said on Friday, ahead of travelling to the capital. "I think we should really look at it one season at a time and this season we can achieve winning a trophy which would be amazing for everyone.One of the key match-ups in Sunday's final is likely to be Isak's battle with Reds captain Virgil van Dijk.

    The forward, whose record is particularly impressive, has three goals and one assist in the five times he's faced a Liverpool side containing Van Dijk in the Premier League.
    
    "I wouldn't say I fear anyone, that's a strong word." Isak said, when asked about facing the Dutchman. "I have a lot of respect for Van Dijk and their whole defence.</h3>
